# Hi, I'm Diego!  

Welcome to my portfolio! I am a Data Scientist with a strong background in machine learning, predictive modeling, and data-driven decision-making. My expertise lies in leveraging Python, SQL, NLP, and cloud computing to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets.

Here, you’ll find a showcase of projects where I apply cutting-edge AI techniques to solve real-world problems. From sentiment analysis of Amazon reviews to predictive analytics and deep learning, each project reflects my commitment to innovation, efficiency, and impactful results.

I am passionate about turning data into actionable strategies, optimizing business outcomes, and continuously exploring new technologies

## About Me  

I am a **Data Scientist** with experience in data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling. My main focus is on data-driven decision-making and analytics.  

## Projects  

### Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Pet Product Reviews
In this project, I developed a machine learning model to analyze sentiment in Amazon reviews of dog products. Using a large-scale dataset (16M reviews), I implemented advanced NLP techniques, including transfer learning with RoBERTa, to classify reviews as positive or negative.

To optimize performance, I leveraged RAPIDS cuDF for fast data processing and UMAP for dimensionality reduction. The best-performing model was deployed using FastAPI and Streamlit, allowing real-time testing with actual Amazon reviews.

#### Key Highlights:
- Balanced dataset: From 100K to 300K well-processed reviews
- Cutting-edge NLP: Transfer learning with RoBERTa
- Scalability & Speed: Optimized with RAPIDS cuDF
- Deployment: Interactive testing via FastAPI & Streamlit
